# The Internet vs. the Web

# Clients and Servers

# HTTP
*Hyper Text Transfer Protocol*

* the avrige request amount of a webpage in an http is 200-300.
* http can make more then one connection. It works asynchronously. (it depends on the browser how many connections are possible)
* to improve this many to many solution, we got http2. 

#### HTTP Methods

#### HTTP Status Codes

# HTTP/2    
* Binary protocols / Text based
    * less bandwidth
* Multiplexing / Line blocking
    * Multiple Requests over one TCP connection
* Increased security
    * Only via secured connections
* Server Push 
* Header Compression 

#### Binary vs. Text 

#### Header Compression

#### Server Push

#### Benefits
* The client saves pushed resources in the cache.
* the client can reuse these cached resources across diffenrent pages
* The server can multiplex pushed resources along with originally requesed information within the same TCP connection. 

# DNS
